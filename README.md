# spatial_mapping

This is a demonstration of doing spatial mapping between the coarse resolution and high resolution image. It mainly makes up of two parts and the first part is finding the corresponding indexes for the geo-transformation and the second part is the PSF modelling. 

This repository is only for the spatial mapping, so the optimization of PSF parameters are not considered in this one, which will be on another repository...
